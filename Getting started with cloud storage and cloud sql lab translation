## Lab: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL

##Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

   Create a Cloud Storage bucket and place an image into it.

   Create a Cloud SQL instance and configure it.

   Connect to the Cloud SQL instance from a web server.

   Use the image in the Cloud Storage bucket on a web page.

## Steps: 

1. Deploy a web server VM instance
       gcp console compute engine create vn-instances --name-bloghost --machine-type 'default' --image-project 'debian-cloud' --image 'debian-9-stretch-v20190213' --tags-allow

       gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=allow --destination=INGRES rule=http:8- --target-tags=http

   enter the following script as the value for startup script

       apt-get update
       apt-get install apache2 php php-mysql -y
       service apache2 restart

## On the VM instances page, copy the bloghost VM instance's internal and external IP addresses to a text editor for use later in this lab.


2. Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the gsutil command line

export LOCATION=US


## In Cloud Shell, the DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID environment variable contains your project ID. Enter this command to make a bucket named after your project ID:

       gsutil mb -l $LOCATION gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

## Retrieve a banner image from a publicly accessible Cloud Storage location:

       gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfci/my-excellent-blog.png my-excellent-blog.png

## Copy the banner image to your newly created Cloud Storage bucket:

       gsutil cp my-excellent-blog.png gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png

## Modify the Access Control List of the object you just created so that it is readable by everyone:

       gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png

3. Create the Cloud SQL instance

       gcp console create SQL instance --database-engine 'mysql' --instance-id 'blog-db' --root password 'password'

## Set the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
This is the same region and zone into which you launched the bloghost instance. The best performance is achieved by placing the client and the database close to each other.

## From the SQL instances details page, copy the Public IP address for your SQL instance to a text editor for use later in this lab.

       gsutil create user account --user-name 'blogdbuser' password 'password'

## Make a note of your password.

       gsutil add network --network-name 'web-front-end' --network 'bloghost external ip followed by /32'

## Be sure to use the external IP address of your VM instance followed by /32. Do not use the VM instance's internal IP address.



4. Configure an application in a Compute Engine instance to use Cloud SQL

        gcloud Compute Engine-vm-instances --ssh 'bloghost' action=change --working-directory=cd/var/www/html

## Use the nano text editor to edit a file called index.php:

        sudo nano index.php

## Paste the content below into the file:

<html>
<head><title>Welcome to my excellent blog</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to my excellent blog</h1>
<?php
 $dbserver = "CLOUDSQLIP";
$dbuser = "blogdbuser";
$dbpassword = "DBPASSWORD";
// In a production blog, we would not store the MySQL
// password in the document root. Instead, we would store it in a
// configuration file elsewhere on the web server VM instance.

$conn = new mysqli($dbserver, $dbuser, $dbpassword);

if (mysqli_connect_error()) {
        echo ("Database connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
} else {
        echo ("Database connection succeeded.");
}
?>
</body></html>

## In a later step, you will insert your Cloud SQL instance's IP address and your database password into this file. For now, leave the file unmodified.

## save file and exit the nano text editor

Restart the web server:

     sudo service apache2 restart

## Open a new web browser tab and paste into the address bar your bloghost VM instance's external IP address followed by /index.php. 

# Be sure to use the external IP address of your VM instance followed by /index.php. Do not use the VM instance's internal IP address. Do not use the sample IP address shown here.


Return to your ssh session on bloghost. Use the nano text editor to edit index.php again.

      sudo nano index.php  action=replace --cloudsqlip to 'cloudsql-instance-publicip'


## In the nano text editor, replace DBPASSWORD with the Cloud SQL database password that you defined above. Leave the quotation marks around the value in place.

## save file and exit the nano text editor

Restart the web server:

       sudo service apache2 restart

## Return to the web browser tab in which you opened your bloghost VM instance's external IP address. When you load the page, the following message appears:

Database connection succeeded.


5. Configure an application in a Compute Engine instance to use a Cloud Storage object


        gcp console storage browser --bucket-name 'my-excellent-blog.png'

## If you see neither a link icon nor a "Public link", try refreshing the browser. If you still do not see a link icon, return to Cloud Shell and confirm that your attempt to change the object's Access Control list with the gsutil acl ch command was successful.

        ssh vm-instance


# Enter this command to set your working directory to the document root of the web server:

        cd /var/www/html
# Use the nano text editor to edit index.php:

        sudo nano index.php

## Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line that contains the h1 element. Press Enter to open up a new, blank screen line, and then paste the URL you copied earlier into the line.

# Paste this HTML markup immediately before the URL:

        <img src='

#Place a closing single quotation mark and a closing angle bracket at the end of the URL:

        '>

# The resulting line will look like this: 
<img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/qwiklabs-gcp-0005e186fa559a09/my-excellent-blog.png'>

# The effect of these steps is to place the line containing <img src='...'> immediately before the line containing <h1>...</h1>

       Save and exit the nano text editor

#Restart the web server:

       sudo service apache2 restart
