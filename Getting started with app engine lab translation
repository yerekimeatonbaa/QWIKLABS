## Lab: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

    Initialize App Engine.

    Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

    Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

    Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

## Steps

1.   Initialize App Engine

        gcloud auth list

        gcloud config list project

        gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

# When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located.

# Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

       git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

       cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Run Hello World application locally

# In this task, you run the Hello World application in a local, virtual environment in Cloud Shell.

# Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.
 
       sudo apt-get update

# Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.

       sudo apt-get install virtualenv

       If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
       virtualenv -p python3 venv

# Activate the virtual environment.

       source venv/bin/activate

# Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

       pip install  -r requirements.txt

       python main.py

## In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.
To access the Web preview icon, you may need to collapse the Navigation menu.


# To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.

Google Cloud Console verify that the app is not deployed. 

      gcp cloud console --navigation-menu --App-Engine --Dashboard.

# Notice that no resources are deployed.

3. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

# Navigate to the source directory:

       cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

       gcloud app deploy

# If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.

# Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

       gcloud app browse
# Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.

4. Disable the application


       gcp cloud console --navigation-menu --app-engine --settings 'disable application'

# Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.
